      <description>I have wanted to write a short post about this topic for some time now, and today I will make this thought tangible. Learning web development is difficult. This statement warrants no comment for anyone who has attempted to learn the craft, but I hazard it here for my own edification.
Part of the difficulty in learning web development stems from the proliferation of information and tutorials spattered across the web.</description>

      <description>Hello World: 2.0. I have been inspired recently by the great content that also happens to be available absolutely FREE (shout out to Tania Rascia)! All of the blogs and resources I have discovered over the past few months have pushed me to learn more than I ever thought possible and as I continue along this journey, I plan to make a more sustained effort in giving back whatever concepts or techniques I have learned for the sake of others.</description>

<h2>Hello World: 2.0.</h2>

I have been inspired recently by the great content that also happens to be available absolutely FREE (shout out to <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/">Tania Rascia</a>)!
All of the blogs and resources I have discovered over the past few months have pushed me to learn more than I ever thought possible and 
as I continue along this journey, I plan to make a more sustained effort in giving back whatever concepts or techniques I have learned for the sake of others.

<h2>Up Next</h2>

Until we meet again: keep reading, keep sharing, and keep coding!
